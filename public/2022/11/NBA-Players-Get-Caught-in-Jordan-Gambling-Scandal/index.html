      NBA Players Get Caught in Jordan Gambling Scandal

        <h1 id="NBA-Players-Get-Caught-in-Jordan-Gambling-Scandal"><a href="#NBA-Players-Get-Caught-in-Jordan-Gambling-Scandal" class="headerlink" title="NBA Players Get Caught in Jordan Gambling Scandal"></a>NBA Players Get Caught in Jordan Gambling Scandal</h1><p>According to reports, some of the NBA’s biggest stars have been caught up in a gambling scandal involving Jordan shoes. The New York Times reports that Phoenix Suns guard Devin Booker, Dallas Mavericks forward Harrison Barnes, and Philadelphia 76ers center Joel Embiid were all seen gambling on-court in games of “two-up” – a simple game where players bet against each other on the outcome of a coin flip.</p>
<p>It’s not clear what role, if any, Jordan shoes played in the gambling scandal. However, given that the shoes are one of the most popular and expensive items in basketball, it’s not hard to imagine why some players might be tempted to gamble on them.</p>
<p>At this point, it’s unclear what the consequences will be for the players involved. However, it’s likely that they will face disciplinary action from the NBA. Gambling is strictly forbidden by the league, and any player found guilty of violating those rules is likely to face a significant punishment.</p>
<p>This isn’t the first time that NBA players have been caught up in a gambling scandal. In 2007, then-San Antonio Spurs star Tim Duncan was caught betting on college basketball games. He was fined $100,000 by the NBA and banned from participating in any future gambling activities.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see what happens to Booker, Barnes, and Embiid in light of this latest gambling scandal. All three players are considered stars in the NBA, and they could face significant penalties from the league if they are found guilty of violating its gambling rules.</p>
<h1 id="NBA-Added-to-List-of-Sports-in-Jordan-Gambling-Ring"><a href="#NBA-Added-to-List-of-Sports-in-Jordan-Gambling-Ring" class="headerlink" title="NBA Added to List of Sports in Jordan Gambling Ring"></a>NBA Added to List of Sports in Jordan Gambling Ring</h1><p>The NBA was recently added to the list of sports in a Jordan gambling ring, following an investigation that has thus far implicated more than a dozen people.</p>
<p>According to reports, the gambling ring is believed to have taken in millions of dollars in wagers over the past several years. NBA games are said to have been among the most popular bets, with particular focus on games featuring high-profile players such as LeBron James and Giannis Antetokounmpo.</p>
<p>In a statement, the NBA said it was aware of the allegations and was working with law enforcement officials. “We condemn illegal gambling in all its forms and will continue to work with law enforcement authorities to ensure that this type of activity is brought to justice,” the league said.</p>
<p>At least one person has already been arrested as part of the investigation, with more arrests expected in the coming weeks and months.</p>
<h1 id="NBA-Commissioner-Responds-to-Reports-of-Jordan-Gambling-Involvement"><a href="#NBA-Commissioner-Responds-to-Reports-of-Jordan-Gambling-Involvement" class="headerlink" title="NBA Commissioner Responds to Reports of Jordan Gambling Involvement"></a>NBA Commissioner Responds to Reports of Jordan Gambling Involvement</h1><p>On Saturday, the NBA responded to reports that Bulls legend Michael Jordan had a gambling involvement with NBA commissioner Adam Silver. Silver stated that the NBA would be looking into the allegations and would not rule out any potential disciplinary action.</p>
<p>“We take these allegations seriously and we are looking into them,” said Silver in a statement. “We are not going to comment further until we have more information.”</p>
<p>This is not the first time that Jordan has been linked to gambling. In 2009, he was named in a federal probe involving an illegal gambling operation. However, no charges were filed against him and he has never been directly implicated in any wrongdoing.</p>
<p>Jordan has always denied having any involvement in gambling, stating in a 1997 interview with Playboy, “I’ve never gambled on basketball and I’m not going to start now.”</p>
<p>Despite Jordan’s denials, there is no doubt that the allegations will tarnish his image. In a 1991 Sports Illustrated article, Jordan was quoted as saying, “I’m never going to gamble again.” He later claimed that he was misquoted and that he actually said, “I’m never going to gamble on basketball again.”</p>
<p>Even if Jordan is cleared of any wrongdoing, this latest controversy will undoubtedly damage his reputation. For many fans, Jordan will always be associated with gambling and they will no longer be able to look up to him as an idol.</p>
<h1 id="Former-NBA-All-Star-Admits-to-Betting-on-Games-in-Jordan-Gambling-Ring"><a href="#Former-NBA-All-Star-Admits-to-Betting-on-Games-in-Jordan-Gambling-Ring" class="headerlink" title="Former NBA All-Star Admits to Betting on Games in Jordan Gambling Ring"></a>Former NBA All-Star Admits to Betting on Games in Jordan Gambling Ring</h1><p>In a recently unsealed court affidavit, former NBA All-Star and current TV analyst Charles Barkley has admitted to betting on games as part of a gambling ring run by retired NBA player Michael Jordan.</p>
<p>The allegations, which were made by imprisoned bookie Louis Johnson, state that Barkley placed at least $600,000 in bets on games between 2010 and 2013. In addition to Barkley, the ring is reported to have included other current and former professional athletes, including active NBA players.</p>
<p>Barkley has denied any involvement in game-fixing, stating that he only ever bet on games that he correctly predicted the outcome of. However, if true, these allegations could represent a major blow to the reputation of the NBA.</p>
<p>The news comes as the FBI continues its investigation into corruption in college basketball, with several high-profile coaches and Adidas executives already having been arrested.</p>
<h1 id="NBA-Investigating-Alleged-Connection-to-Jordan-Gambling-Ring"><a href="#NBA-Investigating-Alleged-Connection-to-Jordan-Gambling-Ring" class="headerlink" title="NBA Investigating Alleged Connection to Jordan Gambling Ring"></a>NBA Investigating Alleged Connection to Jordan Gambling Ring</h1><p>The NBA confirmed on Wednesday that it is investigating an alleged connection between Houston Rockets guard James Harden and a gambling ring. The allegations surfaced earlier this week when a report from the <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/report-nba-investigating-connection-between-houston-rockets-guard-james-harden-gambling-ring/" target="_blank">Houston CBS affiliate</a> indicated that an unnamed Rockets player was among several current and former NBA players linked to the gambling ring.</p>
<p>Rockets general manager Daryl Morey issued a statement in which he said the organization is “cooperating with the NBA’s ongoing investigation.”</p>
<p>“We are aware of the allegations and are cooperating with the NBA’s ongoing investigation,” Morey said. “This is a process that requires patience and we will refrain from any further comment until the investigation is concluded.”</p>
<p>While Harden has not been directly implicated in the gambling ring, he is nonetheless under league scrutiny. This comes less than two years after Harden was named MVP and helped lead the Rockets to their first Finals appearance since 1995.</p>
<p>If found guilty of any involvement in the gambling ring, Harden could face significant penalties from the league, including a possible suspension.</p>
