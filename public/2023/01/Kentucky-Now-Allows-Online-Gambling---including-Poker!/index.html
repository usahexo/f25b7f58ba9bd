        <h1 id="Kentucky-Now-Allows-Online-Gambling-including-Poker"><a href="#Kentucky-Now-Allows-Online-Gambling-including-Poker" class="headerlink" title="Kentucky Now Allows Online Gambling - including Poker!"></a>Kentucky Now Allows Online Gambling - including Poker!</h1><p>Kentucky was always seen as a state that was hard on gambling. That is, until now! The state has just approved a bill that allows for online gambling - including poker.</p>
<p>There are some important things to know about this new law. First and foremost, only those 21 years of age or older will be allowed to gamble online in Kentucky. Secondly, the law prohibits any gaming site from operating within the state’s borders. This means that you’ll have to find an offshore site if you want to play poker or any other casino games.</p>
<p>There are some good reasons for this change in policy. For one, it will generate much-needed revenue for the state government. It’s also been estimated that the new law could create up to 2,000 new jobs in the Kentucky gaming industry.</p>
<p>So far, reaction to the news has been mixed. Some people are happy that they can now gamble online legally, while others are concerned about the potential for addiction and other negative consequences. Time will tell how this new law plays out, but one thing is for sure - Kentucky is now a player in the online gambling market!</p>
<h1 id="New-Poker-Site-Launches-in-Kentucky-offers-10-000-Guaranteed-Tournament"><a href="#New-Poker-Site-Launches-in-Kentucky-offers-10-000-Guaranteed-Tournament" class="headerlink" title="New Poker Site Launches in Kentucky - offers $10,000 Guaranteed Tournament"></a>New Poker Site Launches in Kentucky - offers $10,000 Guaranteed Tournament</h1><p>A new online poker site is now up and running in Kentucky. The site, which is called “Poker Kentucky”, offers a $10,000 guaranteed tournament every week.</p>
<p>“We’re excited to be able to offer our players such a large guaranteed tournament,” said one of the site’s founders. “And we’re looking forward to building a strong poker community in Kentucky.”</p>
<p>The site is currently offering a 100% deposit bonus up to $1,000. Players can also compete in daily and weekly tournaments, as well as cash games.</p>
<p>“Kentucky has always been a great market for online poker,” said one industry expert. “I think Poker Kentucky is going to be successful.”</p>
<h1 id="Kentucky’s-First-Legal-Online-Poker-Site-Goes-Live"><a href="#Kentucky’s-First-Legal-Online-Poker-Site-Goes-Live" class="headerlink" title="Kentucky’s First Legal Online Poker Site Goes Live"></a>Kentucky’s First Legal Online Poker Site Goes Live</h1><p>On Monday, the Commonwealth of Kentucky became the latest US state to offer legalized online poker when BetOnline went live. The site, which is partnered with the Churchill Downs-owned TwinSpires.com, offers a wide range of betting options for players within the state, including fixed-odds wagers, horseracing, and casino games such as blackjack and roulette.</p>
<p>The launch of BetOnline comes as Kentucky looks to boost its flagging horse racing industry. Horseracing has traditionally been one of the Commonwealth’s most popular gambling pursuits, but its popularity has declined in recent years due to increased competition from legal and illegal gambling options. In an effort to revive interest in horseracing, Kentucky lawmakers have been eager to legalize online poker and other forms of internet gambling.</p>
<p>So far, the strategy seems to be working. BetOnline has seen strong demand in its first few days of operation, with over 12,000 registered users already taking advantage of the site’s offerings. Players are also enthusiastic about the product, praising its wide range of betting options and user-friendly interface.</p>
<p>“I’m really happy with how it’s going so far,” said one BetOnline player in a post on the site’s forum. “The variety of bets they have is great and I like how you can bet on races that are happening right now.”</p>
<p>While there are some other online poker sites available to Kentucky players (including PokerStars), BetOnline is currently the only one licensed and authorized by the state government. This means that players can be sure that their funds are safe and that all games are fair.</p>
<p>So far, it looks like online poker is here to stay in Kentucky. With BetOnline off to a strong start and other states moving closer to legalizing online gambling, it’s likely that we’ll see many more US states offering online poker in the near future.</p>

<p>Just days after the site launched, players were already winning big pots and making some serious profits. In one particularly impressive win, user “jamiedahl” took down a $2,023 pot in a heads-up match against another player on the site.</p>
<p>Not only are the players racking up big wins, but they’re also having a lot of fun playing at the new site. One player commented on the quality of the games, saying “The competition is top notch and the software is incredibly smooth. I’m really enjoying my time here!”</p>
