#  NL West teams primed to capitalize on betting opportunities 

The NL West teams are all looking primed to take advantage of any betting opportunities this season. The Dodgers, Giants, and Rockies all made some big moves in the offseason and should be competitive in the division.

The Dodgers made the biggest splash of any team in the division, acquiring Manny Machado from the Orioles. Machado is one of the best players in baseball and gives the Dodgers a huge boost both offensively and defensively. They also acquired other players such as Brian Dozier and Yasmani Grandal, which should help them compete for a World Series title.

The Giants also made some big moves this offseason, adding Evan Longoria and Andrew McCutchen to their lineup. They also acquired Austin Jackson and Tony Watson, which should help them compete in a tough NL West.

The Rockies added some key pieces this offseason as well, acquiring Ian Desmond, Daniel Murphy, and Wade Davis. Desmond provides some much-needed power to their lineup, while Murphy and Davis give them some great production at second base and closer, respectively.

All of these teams look poised to take advantage of any betting opportunities that may come their way this season. Be sure to keep an eye on them as the season progresses!

#  Dodgers, Rockies among league's best bets for gambling success 

The MLB season is underway, and while there are still plenty of teams with a chance to make a run at the World Series, a few have already emerged as early favorites. According

The Colorado Rockies, who ranked first in the National League in wins last season, are once again among the league's best bets for gambling success. They boast an impressive lineup led by Nolan Arenado and Charlie Blackmon, and their pitching staff is anchored by ace German Marquez.

The Los Angeles Dodgers, who lost to the Houston Astros in last year's World Series, are also considered strong contenders this season. Led by superstars Clayton Kershaw and Cody Bellinger, they are expected to be one of the most formidable teams in the league.

Other teams that are worth keeping an eye on include the Boston Red Sox, who won 108 games last season before being eliminated by the Houston Astros in the ALDS; and the Chicago Cubs, who are looking to rebound after a disappointing 2017 campaign.

#  MLB's NL West offers plenty of options for sports bettors 

The National League (NL) West Division is always a hotly contested division and this year is no exception. The Arizona Diamondbacks, Los Angeles Dodgers, San Diego Padres, San Francisco Giants, and Colorado Rockies are all vying for the top spot.

The NL West offers plenty of options for sports bettors. Let's take a look at each team.

The Arizona Diamondbacks are coming off a disappointing season in which they finished last in the division. However, they made some key offseason acquisitions and are primed for a rebound season. Their lineup is led by Paul Goldschmidt and A.J. Pollock, both of whom are All-Stars. The Diamondbacks also have a strong pitching staff led by Zack Greinke and Robbie Ray. They are definitely worth considering as contenders this year.

The Los Angeles Dodgers had the best record in baseball last year and should be even stronger this year with the additions of Yu Darvish and Logan Forsythe. Clayton Kershaw is still one of the best pitchers in baseball, and their lineup is stacked with hitters like Corey Seager, Justin Turner, Yasiel Puig, Joc Pederson, and Cody Bellinger. The Dodgers are the clear favorites to win the NL West this year.

The San Diego Padres had a rough year last year but made some key acquisitions this offseason that could help them turn things around in 2018. They acquired Eric Hosmer from the Kansas City Royals and Bryan Mitchell from the New York Yankees. Hosmer is one of the most consistent hitters in baseball, while Mitchell has upside as a young pitcher. The Padres also have Wil Myers and Manny Margot leading their lineup. They are definitely worth considering as sleeper picks this season.

The San Francisco Giants had an up-and-down season last year but still managed to win 88 games and finish second in the division. They lost out on Giancarlo Stanton in free agency but made some other nice acquisitions, including Andrew McCutchen from the Pittsburgh Pirates and Evan Longoria from the Tampa Bay Rays. Buster Posey and Brandon Crawford anchor an impressive infield, while Madison Bumgarner is still one of the best pitchers in baseball. The Giants will be competitive again this season and could surprise some people.

The Colorado Rockies finished third in the division last year but should be improved this season with healthy seasons from Nolan Arenado and Charlie Blackmon. DJ LeMahieu had a breakout season batting .348 last year and Trevor Story hit 27 home runs. The Rockies also added Wade Davis to their bullpen to strengthen their late innings pitching options. They are definitely worth considering as dark horse candidates to make a run at the division title this year

#  Padres, Giants offer intriguing wagering opportunities in NL West 

In the opening weeks of the baseball season, sportsbooks are releasing their odds for which teams will make it to the postseason. The National League West is one division that offers several intriguing opportunities for bettors.

The San Diego Padres currently have the best odds to win the NL West at +225. This may come as a surprise to some people, as they are in the same division as the Los Angeles Dodgers – who are often considered to be one of the favorites to win the World Series. However, the Dodgers have not looked particularly strong so far this season and many experts are predicting that they will not be able to keep up with the Padres.

If you are looking for an underdog to bet on, the Oakland Athletics offer great value at +4000. The A’s finished last season with a record of 75-87, but they have made several key acquisitions in the offseason and are looking like a much stronger team this year. They are currently in first place in the AL West and could very well make a run at winning their division.

The San Francisco Giants are another team that offer great value at +2000. Last season, they finished with a record of 73-89 and were in last place in their division. However, this year they have made several big signings and seem to be much improved. The Giants also have a very easy schedule in the first few months of the season, which could help them get off to a good start.

If you are looking for a team that is likely to disappoint, the Colorado Rockies may be a good option. They are currently listed at +600 to win the NL West, but there is a good chance that they will not live up to these expectations. The Rockies had a disappointing season last year and do not appear to have made any significant improvements this year.

#  Who will win the NL West? Gambling experts weigh in

The National League West is a tight division, with just four games separating the first-place Dodgers and last-place Padres as of Aug. 1. Who will come out on top in the end?

Gambling experts are divided on who will win the NL West. Some say the Dodgers’ deep roster will carry them to the finish line, while others think the Rockies’ home-field advantage will be enough to propel them to first place.

Here’s a look at how the odds stack up for each team:

LA Dodgers: +130

Colorado Rockies: +200

Arizona Diamondbacks: +275

San Diego Padres: +350

San Francisco Giants: +750

As you can see, the Dodgers are favored to win, but the Rockies are close behind. The Diamondbacks and Padres are long shots, while the Giants are almost no chance at all to take home the division title.
