#  Delaware park casino sold to group led by DraftKings CEO

The Delaware Park casino has been sold to a group led by DraftKings CEO Jason Robins, the companies announced Monday.

Terms of the deal were not disclosed, but the sale is expected to close in the third quarter.

Robins is buying the property with two unnamed business partners. He will become the casino's new CEO.

The property has 1,500 slot machines and 95 table games. It also has a hotel with 220 rooms and a spa.

Delaware Park joins two other casinos that have been sold in the past year. The Harrah's Philadelphia casino was bought by Rock Gaming last December, and the Tropicana Atlantic City casino was sold to Eldorado Resorts in March.

The Delaware park casino has been sold for $320 million to a real estate investment trust. The casino, which is located in the state of Delaware, will now be known as the Harrington Raceway and Casino.

The sale comes as a bit of a surprise because the casino had been on the market for quite some time. In fact, it was first listed for sale back in 2005. However, it seems that no one was interested in purchasing the property at that time.

The current owner of the casino, Penn National Gaming, announced that they were selling the property last month. However, they didn't reveal who the buyer was until now.

The new owner of the casino is Bart Blatstein, who is a well-known Philadelphia developer. He has been involved in a number of different businesses over the years, including real estate, night clubs and casinos.

Blatstein is excited about this new purchase and says that he plans to make some major improvements to the casino. He wants to turn it into a "world-class" property that will be able to compete with other casinos in the area.

Penn National Gaming is also happy with the sale. They say that this will allow them to focus on their other properties in Pennsylvania and Florida.

The Delaware park casino is being sold to DraftKings CEO, Jason Robins for an undisclosed amount. The casino, which has been in operation for over 30 years, is a popular tourist destination in the state.

Robins, who is a Boston-based entrepreneur, founded DraftKings in 2012. The company is one of the largest daily fantasy sports operators in the world. Robins has been looking to expand his business interests into the casino market and this acquisition provides him with a foothold in the industry.

Delaware park casino will continue to operate under its current name and management team. Robins plans to invest in the property and make improvements to enhance the customer experience. He also intends to make the casino more accessible to players from other states.

This news comes as a surprise to many as Delaware's gambling laws are among the most restrictive in the country. The state does not permit online gambling and only allows casinos on its three racetracks. However, it appears that Robins is confident that he can make progress with lawmakers to expand casino gaming in Delaware.

The sale of Delaware park casino is expected to close in early 2018.

#  Delaware park casino being sold to group that includes DraftKings CEO

The Delaware park casino is being sold to a group that includes DraftKings CEO Jason Robins, according to a source familiar with the matter.

Robins is part of a consortium of investors that also includes Los Angeles-based investment firm Oaktree Capital Management and Greenwood Gaming and Entertainment, the parent company of the Philadelphia 76ers and the operator of Parx Casino in Bensalem, Pa.

The new group will pay about $220 million for the casino and plans to invest an additional $40 million in the property, said the source, who was not authorized to speak publicly about the deal.

The sale is expected to close within 60 days.

Delaware park casino is one of three casinos in the state, along with Delaware Sports Park and Harrington Raceway & Casino. The casinos are owned by Caesarâ€™s Entertainment, which has been looking to sell them for years.

In January, Reuters reported that Caesars was in advanced talks to sell all three properties for more than $300 million to a group led by Michigan-based Hoosier Racing Corp., which operates horse tracks in Indiana and Ohio. That deal fell apart in March.

It was announced on Wednesday that the Delaware park casino is being purchased by a group including DraftKings CEO Jason Robins. The deal is worth $1.3 billion and is expected to be finalized by the end of the year.

The purchase includes the casino, racetrack, and harness racing operations. The group also purchased Presque Isle Downs & Casino in Pennsylvania for $280 million.

This is the latest move in the casino industry, as more and more states legalize gambling. Delaware park casino is one of the oldest casinos in the country, opening in 1933.

Robins released a statement saying "We are excited to be purchasing two of the most iconic casinos in the Northeast.. We look forward to working with the team at Delaware Park to create an amazing experience for guests."
