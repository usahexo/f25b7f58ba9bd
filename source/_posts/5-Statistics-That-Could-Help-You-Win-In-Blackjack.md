#  5 Statistics That Could Help You Win In Blackjack

As with any game of chance, there are a few statistics that can give you the winning edge in blackjack. Knowing these stats and applying them while playing will help improve your chances of walking away a winner.

1. The house edge on blackjack is around 1%. This means that for every $100 you bet, you can expect to lose about $1 in the long run. However, by using basic strategy, you can reduce the house edge to as low as 0.5%.

2. Aces are the most valuable cards in blackjack, as they can be worth either 1 or 11 points. Therefore, it’s important to make sure you don’t stand on totals of 12 or more if you have an Ace in your hand.

3. In general, you should always hit on a total of 16 or less and stand on totals of 17 or more. However, this rule can be broken when the dealer is showing an Ace, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 – in which case you should hit if your total is between 12 and 16 inclusive.

4. The probability of being dealt a blackjack (an Ace and a 10 point card) is around 1 in 21 hands. If you’re lucky enough to get one, make sure to bet big!

5. Most casinos allow players to double down on any two cards. This gives you the chance to increase your initial bet by up to 100% if things are going well. However, don’t be too liberal with this option – remember that it’s still a casino game and the house edge still applies!

#  3 Moves To Increase Your Chances Of Winning In Blackjack 

There are many different ways that blackjack players can increase their chances of winning, but there are three specific moves that tend to work better than the others. By following these tips, players can improve their odds and walk away with more money in their pocket.

The first move is to always split pairs of aces and eights. This is one of the simplest moves that blackjack players can make, and it can really help to improve their odds. Splitting pairs gives players two separate hands to play, which increases their chances of winning on at least one of them.

Another move that players should make is to double down on 11. When they do this, they are doubling their bet and getting just one more card. This move can be risky, but it can also pay off big if the player gets a good card.

The last move that players should make is to take insurance when the dealer has an ace showing. This is a risky proposition, but it can be worth it if the player is confident in their ability to beat the dealer’s hand. Taking insurance gives players a chance to win back some of their money if the dealer manages to get a blackjack.

By following these three moves, blackjack players can give themselves a better chance of winning at the casino. These tips are simple, but they can make a big difference in the player’s odds of success.

#  How The Stats Can Help You In The Game Of Blackjack  

One of the most popular casino games around is blackjack. It is a game that can be enjoyed by players of all experience levels, from novice to experienced. The possibility of winning large sums of money has made it one of the most favoured games in the casino.

In order to increase your chances of winning when playing blackjack, you can use the statistics provided by online blackjack calculators. These calculators take all the important factors into account, including your cards and the dealer’s cards, and provide you with an estimate of what your next move should be.

The advantage of using a calculator is that you can make better decisions while playing, which will give you a better chance of winning. The calculators are not 100% accurate, but they do provide a good estimate which can help you to improve your game.

When using a calculator, it is important to remember that you should always stick to basic blackjack strategy. This involves making certain moves based on the cards you are dealt, and will give you the best chance of winning. You can find more information on basic strategy on websites such as blackjackinfo.com.

It is also important to be aware that blackjack calculators are not infallible – they are only tools that can help you to make better decisions while playing. If you rely too heavily on the calculator results, you may find yourself making mistakes that could cost you money. Always use your own judgement when playing blackjack, and only use the calculator as a guide.

If you are new to blackjack, or if you are looking for ways to improve your game, then using a blackjack calculator can be a great way to boost your chances of winning. By taking into account all the important factors involved in the game, these calculators can help you to make sound decisions while playing – resulting in more wins and less losses. So why not give them a try?

#  What Numbers To Hit Or Stay Away From In Blackjack

The game of blackjack is all about making the right decision at the right time. If you make bad choices, you will lose money. Conversely, if you make good choices, you can win money. In order to help you make good decisions while playing blackjack, in this article we are going to list the numbers that you should hit or stay away from.

Generally speaking, when it comes to blackjack, you want to avoid going over 21. This is because if your total score is more than 21, you automatically lose the hand, regardless of what the dealer’s score is. With that in mind, let’s take a look at some of the numbers that you should hit or stay away from in blackjack.

If your hand totals 6 or lower, then you should always hit. This is because your odds of drawing another card that will bring your total below 21 are high.

If your hand totals 7 or 8, then you should only hit if the Dealer’s upcard is a 2 through 6. If the Dealer’s upcard is anything else, then you should stand.

If your hand totals 9 or 10, then you should always stand. This is because your odds of busting are low and there is no reason to risk going over 21.

If your hand totals 11 or 12, then you should only hit if the Dealer’s upcard is a 2 through 9. If the Dealer’s upcard is anything else, then you should stand.

If your hand totals 13 through 16, then you should hit if the Dealer’s upcard is 2 through 6 and stand if the Dealer’s upcard is anything else.

 Finally, if your hand totals 17 through 21, then you should always stand no matter what the Dealer’s upcard may be.
