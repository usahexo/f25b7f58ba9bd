#  When Does Online Play in Connecticut Start?

In Connecticut, the online play for casino games starts when the live casino opens. For blackjack, roulette, and baccarat, this means play begins at 7am every day. Craps follows at 9am. Poker players can start their action at 11am. Slot players may commence gambling at 12pm.

#  Online Play Begins in Connecticut This Week

A new era in Connecticut online poker began this week as the first regulated games went live. Players can now log into the state-regulated platform and play for real money.

 Regulations were approved in April, and the required technology was ready to go live this week. The launch comes more than two years after lawmakers initially authorized online poker in the state.

Prior to this week, only players on Indian reservations were able to legally play online poker in Connecticut. But that’s all changed now that the state has launched its own regulated platform.

Players must be physically located in Connecticut in order to play on the state-regulated site. This ensures that the games are fair and meet all regulatory requirements.

The launch of online poker in Connecticut is a major development for the industry. The state is now the fifth in the US to offer regulated online poker, joining Nevada, New Jersey, Delaware, and Pennsylvania.

#  Start Times for Online Play in Connecticut Announced

Connecticut residents now have something to look forward to when the weekend rolls around. Starting times for online play in the state have been announced, and they vary depending on which day of the week it is.

If you're looking to get your game on Sunday, you'll have from 6pm to 10pm to do so. Saturday offers a little more leeway, with slots running from 12pm to 10pm. And if you're looking to take things up a notch during the workweek, you can log in from 6pm to midnight on Monday through Thursday.

These hours were determined after surveying Connecticut's gamers about their preferred gaming times. "We want to make sure that everyone has a chance to enjoy our games," said Joe D'Amico of the D'Amico Gaming Corporation, "and these times should provide ample opportunity for players of all levels."

So whether you're a beginner just starting out or a seasoned vet looking for some competition, there's something for everyone in Connecticut's online gaming scene. Get those controllers ready and check out the times below!

Sunday: 6pm-10pm
Saturday: 12pm-10pm

#  Connecticut Players to Join International Competition This Week
