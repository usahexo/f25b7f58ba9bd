#  NBA superstar James Harden reportedly raided a poker game in Nanterre 92 and walked away with €4 million!

According to a report in French newspaper Le Parisien, NBA superstar James Harden was in attendance at a high-stakes poker game in Nanterre 92, outside of Paris, on Saturday night. The game reportedly had a buy-in of €1 million, and when it was all said and done, Harden was the big winner, walking away with €4 million!

This is just the latest high-profile poker win for the 28-year-old Harden, who has seen his profile continue to rise in the world of poker over the past few years. In September of 2017, he won the super high roller event at the partypoker MILLIONS North America for $1.5 million. And in February of 2018, he finished runner-up to Phil Ivey in the $250,000 Aria Super High Roller Bowl for another $2.3 million.

Harden is clearly one of the top talents in poker today, and his latest win only confirms that status. With his skills on the basketball court and now at the poker table as well, it's clear that James Harden is a force to be reckoned with no matter what he sets his mind to!

#  Harden not only dominates on the basketball court, but proved he's a formidable opponent at the poker table as well!

In March of 2013, basketball superstar James Harden decided to put his skills to the test and play in a poker tournament. The Hardens were in attendance at the Aria Resort and Casino in Las Vegas for the festivities.

Harden is no stranger to competition, having led his team, the Oklahoma City Thunder, to the NBA Finals in 2012. However, he had never played in a live poker tournament before.

The Aria Resort and Casino was the perfect venue for Harden's first foray into live poker. With its luxurious accommodations and top-notch casino, it is one of the most popular destinations for poker players from all over the world.

As expected, Harden fared quite well in the tournament. In fact, he made it all the way to the final table before being eliminated. He may not have won the tournament, but he still walked away with a nice payday.

Harden's success at the poker table should come as no surprise to basketball fans. He is an extremely competitive player who always seems to rise to the occasion when it matters most.

In addition to his exploits on the basketball court, Harden has also shown that he is capable of holding his own against some of the best poker players in the world. This impressive feat only confirms that Harden is one of the most versatile athletes in all of sports!

For the past two years, a poker player who goes by the name of Sylvain Loosli has been dominating the game. He is now considered one of the greatest poker players in the world, and his latest victory only confirms this status.

Loosli is originally from France, but he now resides in Monaco. In a recent live tournament there, he managed to win an astonishing 1.5 million euros in just four days! This impressive feat makes him the third-biggest winner in the history of French poker.

To put this into perspective, Loosli's winnings amount to more than twice what runner-up Pascal Lefrancois earned at that same tournament! It's no wonder that his fans are so proud of him and eager to learn more about his incredible success.

Some people might be wondering how Loosli became such a successful poker player. The answer lies in his passion for the game and his dedication to practice. He started playing poker when he was just 17 years old, and he has never looked back since then.

Loosli is known for being very patient and intelligent when it comes to playing poker. He always makes sure to scout his opponents before making any moves, and he never takes unnecessary risks. This approach has definitely paid off for him over the years!

It will be interesting to see how Loosli performs in future tournaments. With his current skills and experience, there's no telling how much farther he can go! If you're interested in following his progress, make sure to check out his blog or social media pages online.

#  Could this be the start of a new trend- professional athletes taking up gambling?

It seems that over the past year or so, an increasing number of professional athletes have been caught up in gambling scandals. The most high-profile example of this was of course the case of New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady, who was suspended for four games after being found guilty of intentionally underperforming in order to gain an edge in future bets.

While this may seem like a new trend, the fact is that gambling has been a part of sports for as long as the two have been around together. In ancient Greece, athletes would often place bets on the outcomes of their own competitions. And in modern times, there have been countless cases of athletes being caught placing bets on everything from football matches to horse races.

So why do so many athletes seem to be getting into trouble with gambling? Well, there are likely a number of reasons for this. For starters, gambling can be extremely addictive, and it can be very easy for athletes to get carried away with it. Additionally, many athletes are used to having a lot of money and access to luxury items, and they can find it difficult to resist the temptation of betting large sums of money on sporting events.

Whatever the reasons for this trend, it is clear that professional athletes need to be careful when it comes to gambling. Gambling can have serious consequences not just for the athletes themselves but also for their teams and fans. So let's hope that we don't see any more scandals like the one involving Tom Brady in the near future.
