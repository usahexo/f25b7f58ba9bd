#  When Does Online Play Start In CT For NBA?

The National Basketball Association or NBA is one of the most popular sports leagues in the entire world. NBA fans are spread out all across the globe, and there is a great deal of anticipation for the upcoming season each and every year. The league’s regular season lasts from October to April, with playoffs taking place in May and June.

Most of the action during the NBA season takes place on weekdays, with games typically starting at 7:00pm or 8:00pm Eastern Standard Time (EST). However, there are a few exceptions to this rule. For instance, on Martin Luther King Jr. Day (a federal holiday in the United States), three games will be played on Monday evening instead of the typical two. And then there are also a number of matchups that take place on Friday and Saturday nights instead of during the day.

So when does online play start in CT for NBA? That depends on what day of the week it is. If it’s a weekday, then online play typically starts at 7:00pm or 8:00pm EST. However, if it’s a weekend then things get a bit more complicated. There are typically two different start times for NBA weekend games: 12:00pm or 3:30pm ET. So if you want to watch an online game on Saturday afternoon, for example, you would need to know what time zone the game is being played in.

For most intrastate sports, the game must start before 11pm. There are some exceptions to this rule, such as horseshoes, where the game can start as late as 1am.
