# How to Play Unlimited Blackjack at 888 Poker - Insights from Dumas

Alexandre Dumas was a famous French writer who lived during the 19th century.

## The Basics of Blackjack

Blackjack is a card game that is played with one or more decks of standard playing cards. The objective of the game is to have a hand value closer to 21 than the dealer's hand value without going over 21, which is called "busting."

Each card in the deck is assigned a point value, with numbered cards being worth their face value, face cards (kings, queens, and jacks) being worth 10 points each, and aces being worth either one or 11 points, depending on which value is more favorable for the player.
