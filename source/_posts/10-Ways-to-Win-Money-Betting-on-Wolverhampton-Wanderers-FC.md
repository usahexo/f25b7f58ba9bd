Wolverhampton Wanderers FC is a professional association football club based in the city of Wolverhampton, West Midlands. The club was formed in 1877 and currently competes in the Championship, the second tier of English football. 

As with all sports, betting on the outcomes of games can be lucrative if done correctly. In order to give yourself the best chance to profit when betting on Wolves matches, it’s important to familiarize yourself with the team and their current form.

In their most recent campaign in the Premier League, Wolves finished 7th – an impressive feat for a newly promoted side. However, they have had a mixed bag of results in their first few games of the new season, winning two, drawing one and losing two. This leaves them 12th in the table and suggests that they are still adapting to life back in the top flight. 

Their next match comes against newly-promoted Sheffield United and is likely to be a close affair. Wolves are slight favourites at odds of 2/1, however United are not to be underestimated and are available at odds of 5/2. A draw is priced at 3/1. 

If you’re looking for bigger odds, Wolves’ next fixture against Chelsea provides plenty of opportunities for shrewd punters. The Blues are odds-on favourites at 1/5 but Wolves are available at a juicy 11/2 to cause an upset. With both teams having started their campaigns poorly, there could well be value in backing Nuno Santo’s side on this occasion. 

There are plenty more bets to be made on Wolves over the coming weeks and months; by doing your research and familiarizing yourself with the team’s strengths and weaknesses, you can give yourself a much better chance of making some healthy profits!
