# The Basic Strategy 

The basic blackjack strategy is the foundation of any good blackjack strategy. It dictates how you should play your hands depending on the dealer’s upcard. There are tables that list the basic strategy, but here are a few tips:

-If the dealer has an ace up, hit unless you have 17 or more points.

-If the dealer has a two up, hit unless you have 12 or more points.

-If the dealer has a three up, hit unless you have 16 or more points.

-If the dealer has a four up, hit unless you have 14 or more points.

-If the dealer has a five up, hit unless you have 13 or more points. 

-If the dealer has a six up, stand on all 17s and 18s. 

Hit on all other Totals of 12 through 16 when Dealer shows 2 - 6 

These basic strategies will give you a good starting point for playing blackjack in Malaysian casinos. However, it’s important to remember that these guidelines are just that – guidelines. You may need to deviate from them depending on the circumstances. For example, if you have an 8 and the dealer has an ace up, you should still hit even though it goes against the basic strategy table.

#  How to Bet at Blackjack - The Complete Guide 

Blackjack is one of the easiest casino games to learn and play, making it a popular choice for novice gamblers. The objective of the game is to beat the dealer by reaching a total score of 21 or closer to 21 than the dealer, without exceeding 21.

Players can bet on their own hand or on the dealer's hand. There are several different blackjack betting strategies that can be used to increase your probability of winning. In this article, we will take a look at the most popular blackjack betting strategies and provide tips on how to use them effectively.

Before we start, it is important to remember that blackjack is a game of chance and there is no guaranteed way to win. However, using sound betting strategies can give you a better chance of winning in the long run.

# The Basic Strategy 
The basic strategy is the most fundamental blackjack betting strategy and should be learned by all players. The basic strategy involves making specific moves based on the cards that are dealt to you. You can find a detailed basic strategy chart online which will show you exactly what moves to make in every possible situation.

While learning the basic strategy may take some time, it is well worth the effort as it will help you to reduce the house edge and increase your chances of winning. It is also important to practice using the basic strategy chart until you are familiar with all of the moves.

# The Insurance Bet 
The insurance bet is a optional side bet that can be made when you are dealt an Ace as your first card. The insurance bet pays 2:1 if the dealer has Blackjack (an Ace and any other card worth 10 points). Most players do not recommend making the insurance bet as it has a high house edge of around 14%. However, if you are feeling lucky, you can choose to make the insurance bet as an extra gamble on your hand.

# Increasing Your Chances of Winning 
There are several ways that you can increase your chances of winning when playing blackjack. Here are some tips: 
- Follow the basic strategy closely - This will help you to make smart plays based on the cards that are dealt to you and give you a better chance of winning. 
- Split pairs whenever possible - When you are dealt two cards of equal value, you can choose to split them into two separate hands, doubling your bets in the process. This gives you more chances to win since each hand now has its own unique set of odds. 
- Stay away from Blackjacks - If you have an 18 or lower, do not take any risks by trying to get a Blackjack - just stick with drawing another card instead. A Blackjack pays 3:2 but getting one puts you at risk of busting (going over 21). 

By following these tips, you can give yourself a better chance of winning when playing blackjack!
